Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter.
You do not need to compile your program before executing it. 
When you execute a program, Python first compiles your source
code (the statements in your file) into a format known  as byte code.
Compilation is simply a translation step, and byte code is a lower-level,
platform-independent representation of your source code. Byte code can
be run much more quickly than the original source code statements in your text 
file. Byte code will be stored in a file with .pyc. Upto puthon 2.x this file 
created in the same directory in with the source file is compiled.
From python3.x this file is created in  __pychache__ folder 
in with the source file is compiled.
