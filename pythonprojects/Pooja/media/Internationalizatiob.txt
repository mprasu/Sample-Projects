The reason why we are uusing this is we have tones of informaton were we cannot be show what actually a user will see
internationalization is about marking  strings for translation

django views
-----------------

from django.utils.translation import gettext
def home(request):
	context={"page_title":gettext("About Us"),
	}
	return render(request, ''home.html", context) 

Translations
django models
------------------

class Revision(models.Model):
	language=models.CharField(max_length=7, default=settings.LANGUAGE_CODE,choices=settings.LANGUAGES)

localization--> date formating, currency formatting between countries
dango settings

USE_L10N=True

Translation catalogs
--ability to merge catalogs
--visualize which strings require translation
-------------
 Difference between internationalization and localization
Internationalization(118N):-It is a process of preparing your application to handle multiple languages
localization(L10N):- it is a process of were adding a perticular language of your locale file to your application 
---------
python 118N with gettext
->gettext provides the baseline for all internationalization in python
->Requires the GNU gettext package on all your server machines
using gettext method
->simply import the below statement
	from django-utils.translation import ugettext, ungettext
(ugettext --> supports unicode strings)
