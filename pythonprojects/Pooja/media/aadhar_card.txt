Women empowerment means empowering women with all their rights they should have in the family, 
society, school, college and country just like a man.
 It is to make them able so that they can make own independent decisions for their personal development.
 The status of women in the Indian society is still backward because of the gender inequality.
 Women also should be given equal rights like men to really empower them. 
They should not be treated as weak gender of the society as they occupy almost half population of the
 country so they are half strength of the country.
 Women have more patience and effort; they can better develop their country.
 It loses the confidence level of women to actively come out of their homes and participate fearlessly in all 
the activities like a man. Some of the crimes against women in India are rape, sexual harassment, 
kidnapping and abduction, dowry death,torture,importation of girls, etc. 
Such crimes inhibit the women empowerment to spread its wings and empower women.

my favourite movie is "3-IDIOTS" because this movie is based on the life of the Engineering studentd
...Amir khan played an fantastic student role in this movie...
this movie is ever green movie as it has given a good message to all the parents as well as to students..
the message is that a parents should not force their child to becum what they wanted ...
many of the parents wants there child to becum an engineer or an doctor but our parents never ask us 
wat we wanted to becum in our lyf...a student will forcibly pushed into enginerring by their parents
 later he will b nt able to perfrom well during his semister as he dont hve interest in this feild...
so the parents ll b scolding,cursing hm due to his bad performance in xams...
only parents are responsible for this...so parents should left upto der child wat he wanted to becum...
and also this movie has given one more great messge to all students dat muggaping the answer ll never 
give u the concept or knwledge. u need to understnd the concept of the answer
 even if u are learning a small defination also...

Wow..! My college days are unforgettable and in fact
those days are happy days in may life. Every student hasthose days in their life's as well.I enjoyed myself a lot
when i was in Jr.College. I have learned a lot from my professors. When ever i was wrong they corrected me. They used to be very friendly with us. We used to have
competitions. No matter whether we win the competition or not, but they used to tell us participation is very
important. They were very supportive and encouraged us in all things to grow up in our life's. We used to crack jokes
on others. We used to comment on others. We used to bunk the class.
 we used to jump the walls for second show movies. If we caught by sir's we led to punish. In fact I experienced.
So, college life is so beautiful, no body can forget those
days in their life's and those days will never be back again.

Facebook is an one of the social networking services which is expanded vastly through out the world with in less span of time.
Facebook website was officially and originally launched by Mark Zuckerberg along with his college
 (Harvard college, located in Cambridge, United States) room mates and fellow students. 
Eventhough the facebook is popular and received a great response from all the people through out the world, 
it has many disadvantages along with the advantages.
Facebook is absolutely free and the people who are having more than 13 years age can register in facebook and access their profile.

It is the best medium for the communciation, we can send messeges, video calling, uploading photos and videos, 
updating status all these are available at free of cost. It connects the different people from any where in the world.

The first and the biggest disadvantage of facebook is that it addctive or anyone can become addictive easily.
 Once we get connected with facebook friends we can relize that how much time we are wasting/spending on facebook,
 by cchating, seeing the other pictures, videos, commenting & liking the pictures of others,etc....

One who understands the importance of time, gives importance to time as well. Time runs continuously. Time does not come back.
Time can't be stored or put by for later use. The best we can do is use time constructively. It is the only thing in the world that we 
cannot store for future. So in conclusion it can be said that anyone who wishes to be great in life must learn to use time greatly.
 Don’t let the precious moments just slip by in idle gossips and trivial activities. Make the best use of time 
How do you manage time?
complete most imoprtant tasks first.. Sleep at least 7-8 hours.. Get an early start..Turn key task into habits
